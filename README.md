Hi there! This is the repository for SIT102: Introduction to Programming.

This repository contains all the tasks I completed for SIT102.
There is a grading schema associated with the top-level folder names of this repository. It denotes the complexity of a particular task.

P = Pass task,
C = Credit task,
D = Distinction task,
H = High Distinction task,

I recommend checking out the H level tasks as these are the best examples of my work in this unit.

Each task contains the final code for the assignment and a PDF file containing the description and the objectives of the task.
